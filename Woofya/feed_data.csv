Harleston Park Dog Off Leash Area,-37.88165499999999,145.0102044,"[""I had the pleasure of dog-sitting a friend's furry companion over the long weekend, and our frequent visits to Harleston Dog Park in Elsternwick left me thoroughly impressed. This park truly offers something for everyone!\n\nFirst and foremost, the unfenced dog run area provided the perfect space for our canine friend to roam and play freely. We visited during the cooler morning hours and again in the evening as the sun was setting, and each time, we were met with a welcoming atmosphere and plenty of room for the dogs to stretch their legs.\n\nBut Harleston Dog Park isn't just for our four-legged friends; it's also a fantastic destination for families and kids. The hilly landscape adds an element of interest, while the playground equipment and rotunda provide opportunities for fun activities and gatherings. We even witnessed several garden birthday parties taking place, which added to the vibrant atmosphere of the park.\n\nFor those looking to stay active, the park boasts a half-size basketball court and a running creek where we could cool off on warmer days. I was particularly impressed by the thoughtful amenities, such as the water fountain with a dog bowl at the bottom ‚Äì a small touch that made a big difference.\n\nWith mature trees providing ample shade, comfortable seating areas, and lush grassy spaces, Harleston Dog Park truly exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this park to anyone looking for a safe, enjoyable outdoor space for their furry friends and family alike.\n\nIt is nestled between beautiful residential houses, but leafy enough that noise from a game of basketball or a children‚Äôs birthday party won‚Äôt be too distracting on a Sunday.\n\nParking.\nFree parking on the road. Not many, but I imagine a lot of locals come here.\n\nAmenities.\nI didn‚Äôt see anything so I am a little unsure sorry."", 'Not ideal for dogs, no off leash area and not enough space for big dogs to run.', 'Great facilities']","[5, 1, 5]"

And dogs, but that's to be expected, though I think we walked past the off-leash area.\n\nGetting to the sand from the car is straightforward, and the path shown is at the same level as the road, with stairs or cut slopes down to the beach itself, which is about fifteen meters lower. The slopes are steep enough that anyone who is unsteady on their feet will likely find the going tricky. And the path is supposed to be pedestrians only - there's a dedicated bike path adjacent to the road - but it's self-policed so you have to keep an eye and ear out for errant riders who rush up on you at speed, irrespective that they shouldn't be there.\n\nThe breakwaters are an easy place to clamber, and ideal for kids looking to have an adventure. Being a bay beach, the waves don't tend to sweep over the breakwaters in calm weather, so there is little danger of being washed away, though there are gaps large and small between the rocks so turning an ankle is possible. The slope on the edges of the breakwater is gentle, so apart from the mossy spots close to the waterline, you shouldn't inadvertently slip your way into the drink if you walk down the sides.\n\nAs with most Melbourne beaches, the sand is coarse with lots of broken shells.

I found myself vacuuming the sofas and carpet 20 mins after we‚Äôd arrived - the vacuum cleaner was dinky so it took ages and hardly picked up the dog hair. Moved it around and that was it. Ugh!!! You know when you have time off for a romantic getaway and the first thing we have to do is the owner or cleaners job? It‚Äôs annoying.  The bathrooms were clean but are dated, there isn‚Äôt a dishwasher and the windows are vertical sliders - why???
